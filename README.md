## Description
The Team Profile Generator is a command-line application built with Node.js that allows managers to generate a webpage displaying information about their software engineering team. The application prompts the user to enter details about the team members, including the manager, engineers, and interns. It then generates an HTML webpage with summaries for each team member.
